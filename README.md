## Support My Work

You can [become a sponsor][Sponsors] to help me dedicate more time on my various [open-source tools][OpenSource]. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a real difference in keeping these tools free and actively developed.



## Getting Started

PickerKit has many pickers and picker-related views.

* ``Camera`` can be used to take photos and handle them as images.
* ``ColorPickerBar`` adds a color picker to a horizontal or vertical bar with additional colors.
* ``DocumentScanner`` can be used to scan documents and handle them as images.
* ``FilePicker`` can be used to pick any file from the Files app.
* ``ImagePicker`` can be used to pick images from the user's photo library.
* ``MultiPicker`` can be used to pick multiple items in e.g. a list or form.

Note that you must add the proper permissions to be able to access the camera, photo album, files, etc. See the documentation for each view for more information.



## Documentation

The online [documentation][Documentation] has more information, articles, code examples, etc.



## Demo Application

The `Demo` folder has a demo app that lets you test the various pickers in the library.
